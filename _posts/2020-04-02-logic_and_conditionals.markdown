In coding, a conditional statement involves an if-then construct. For example, let's say you're writing code and you decide that you want to set different computations or actions based on whether or not the boolean condition evaluates to *true* or *false*, you would begin it in this way. Let's begin with a set of conditions of A,B, and C. You wanted to set this all up, you would begin with defining "A" as a method. Then you would set certain conditions. For example, "If (A=true), then you would set up B as a condition with an if statement, and you would set C as an else statement. This allows the code to run as testing if A is true or false. If A was true then B would follow. However, if A was false then C would follow suit. This is how you set up boolean conditions.
