I decided to go into software engineering after I graduated from CSUN (Cal State University Northridge) with a B.S. degree in Kinesiology. I had gotten into a couple UC's for Computer Science. However, I did not think it was for me as I played three sports and was super active. I did not imagine a sedentary lifestyle for myself. I wanted to always be on my feet and moving. I built my first computer when I was in third grade and fell in love with computers themselves. I loved tinkering with builds and OS's. I decided to make the jump into software engineering after I found out how many doors could be opened within this field. I am excited to learn and I am enjoying the process thus far.
